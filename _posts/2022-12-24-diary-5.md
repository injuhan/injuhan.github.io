It's Saturday! <br>
Since I fell asleep early yesterday, I woke up early today. <br>

I love weekend morning because it's calm, bright. <br>
Most of all, If I wake up early on weekend morning, <br>
it makes me proud myself because I think it's a good start. <br>

As you can see from my list, I didn't write any post yesterday.<br>
It also means I didn't study yesterday. <br>

So, as soon as I woke up in the morning, I sat down at my desk. <br>
I read a book about SQL, taking notes for an hour. <br>
After dinner, I solve the problem to prepare for coding test. <br>

I think you might think my weekend is too ordinary. <br>
Cause there is Christmas in this weekend, I feel delightful, <br>
but that's all. <br>

I know I have to study on Christmas, New Year's Day, and public holidays. 
Why? Because I always wish better me. <br>

I know that if I wrote this in Korean, <br>
it would be much longer and more expressive. <br>

But since I'm not good at English, even if any problem will arise, <br>
I can give an excuse that I did not know how to express it in English.
So I'm writing this in English. <br>

I want to be fluent to English, too. 
However, I know the priority of study related to software engineering is higher than English. <br>

When will I be able to write in English without a translator? <br>
