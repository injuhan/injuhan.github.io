  <h1>Today's me</h1>

  <p><br />
Finally.
Here is my own place. <br />
I am delightful to find theme fits me.</p>

<p>These days, my plan is ‘doing steady anything’. <br />
The reason that I decide to plan like that is just because 
I want to enjoy everything today more than I did yesterday. <br /></p>

<p>To me, joy is watching me grow into a good software engineer. <br />
I think I need to study to be a good engineer. <br /></p>

<p>There are many concept. <br />
However, I think the most important quality to become a good programmer is to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do something consistently</code>. <br /></p>

<p>If you are there, and you are interested in this blog, <br />
you know me or not, please watch me.</p>
