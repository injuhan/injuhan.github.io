  <h1>Today's me</h1>

  <p><br />
It’s Saturday! <br />
Since I fell asleep early yesterday, I woke up early today. <br /></p>

<p>I love weekend morning because it’s calm, bright. <br />
Most of all, If I wake up early on weekend morning, <br />
it makes me proud myself because I think it’s a good start. <br /></p>

<p>As you can see from my list, I didn’t write any post yesterday.<br />
It also means I didn’t study yesterday. <br /></p>

<p>So, as soon as I woke up in the morning, I sat down at my desk. <br />
I read a book about SQL, taking notes for an hour. <br />
After dinner, I solve the problem to prepare for coding test. <br /></p>

<p>I think you might think my weekend is too ordinary. <br />
Cause there is Christmas in this weekend, I feel delightful, <br />
but that’s all. <br /></p>

<p>I know I have to study on Christmas, New Year’s Day, and public holidays. 
Why? Because I always wish better me. <br /></p>

<p>I know that if I wrote this in Korean, <br />
it would be much longer and more expressive. <br /></p>

<p>But since I’m not good at English, even if any problem will arise, <br />
I can give an excuse that I did not know how to express it in English.
So I’m writing this in English. <br /></p>

<p>I want to be fluent to English, too. 
However, I know the priority of study related to software engineering is higher than English. <br /></p>

<p>When will I be able to write in English without a translator? <br /></p>
